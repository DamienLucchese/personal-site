As for my arrows, I use Easton Axis 400 with weighted target tips & feather fletchings. For me, it's about the relationship with the bow, it's about relaxing and letting those arrows fly. It's a challenge but it calms me. Landing tight clusters of bullseyes, time after time, is not my concern. Testing what I can do without sights, stabalizers, & tension assist, is why I got into traditional archery."
